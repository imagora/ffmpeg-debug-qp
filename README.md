# `ffmpeg_debug_qp`

Authors: Werner Robitza, Steve Göring

Synopsis: Prints QP values of input sequence on a per-frame basis to STDERR.

# Requirements

For building

- libavdevice, libavformat, libavfilter, libavcodec, libswresample, libswscale, libavutil
- C compiler

For example on Ubuntu:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/ffmpeg-3
    sudp apt update
    sudo apt install libavdevice-dev libavformat-dev libavfilter-dev libavcodec-dev libswresample-dev libswscale-dev libavutil-dev
    sudo apt install build-essentials

Supported input:

- MPEG-2
- MPEG-4 Part 2
- H.264 / MPEG-4 Part 10 (AVC)

Supported formats:

- MPEG-4 Part 14
- H.264 Annex B bytestreams

# Usage

Build and run the tool:

    make
    ./ffmpeg_debug_qp test.mp4

The output will be as follows:

    ...
    [h264 @ 0x7fcf61813e00] nal_unit_type: X, nal_ref_idc: X
    [h264 @ 0x7fcf61813e00] New frame, type: X
    [h264 @ 0x7fcf61813e00] AABBCCDD...

Where in the above, AA is the QP value of the first macroblock, BB of the second, etc.
For every macroblock row, there will be another row printed per frame.

You can parse the values with the `parse-qp-output.py` script, e.g.

    $ ./ffmpeg_debug_qp test.mp4 2> qp-values.txt
    $ ./parse-qp-output.py qp-values.txt qp-values.json

This produces a JSON file that is easier to parse.
